# Velocity Profile Development in a 2D Channel

Explore the influence of Reynolds number on velocity profile development using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations in OpenFOAM. Gain insights into flow dynamics, validated with analytical solutions. This study has practical applications in industrial fluid mechanics and provides valuable insights into flow development length.

## Key Highlights
