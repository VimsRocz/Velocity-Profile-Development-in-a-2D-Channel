In this study, we explore the influence of Reynolds number on velocity profile development using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations in OpenFOAM. The findings provide key insights into flow behavior in confined geometries, which are crucial for applications such as pipeline design, HVAC systems, propulsion tank in Rocket, aircraft and microfluidics.
ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… Numerical simulations at different Reynolds numbers (Re = 1, 20, 50, 100)
âœ… Validation with analytical solutions
âœ… Insights into flow development length
âœ… Applications in industrial fluid mechanics
